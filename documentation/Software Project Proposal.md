## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### PROJECT OVERVIEW

Dollar Funding, a Merchant Cash Advance (MCA) provider, seeks to revolutionize their application processing system by implementing a cloud-based solution. This project aims to automate the manual data entry process for MCA applications, which are currently received via email and processed by a team of 30 employees. The proposed solution will digitize and streamline the entire workflow, from email receipt to data extraction and client notification.

The system will:
1. Process incoming emails and attachments
2. Extract and classify relevant information from PDF documents
3. Store data securely in a database and cloud storage
4. Provide API and UI interfaces for client interaction
5. Implement webhook notifications for real-time updates

This automation will significantly reduce manual labor, increase efficiency, and improve accuracy in processing MCA applications.

### OBJECTIVES

1. Automate 93% of manual data entry work, replacing 28 out of 30 current staff members
2. Implement a state-of-the-art OCR solution capable of handling imperfect and handwritten applications
3. Develop a secure, scalable, and highly available cloud-based system
4. Create user-friendly API and UI interfaces for seamless client interaction
5. Establish a robust webhook system for real-time application status updates
6. Ensure compliance with data privacy and security regulations

### BUDGET CONSIDERATIONS

Several factors could impact the budget, and we have strategies in place to manage these risks:

1. OCR Technology Performance:
   - Risk: The chosen OCR solution may require additional customization or a more expensive alternative to meet accuracy requirements.
   - Mitigation: We have allocated a substantial budget for OCR licensing and included contingency funds. If needed, we can reallocate resources from other areas or propose a budget adjustment.

2. Cloud Service Costs:
   - Risk: Actual usage may exceed estimates, particularly as the system scales.
   - Mitigation: We will implement cloud cost monitoring and optimization strategies. The contingency budget can cover initial overages, and we'll work with Dollar Funding to adjust the budget if long-term changes are needed.

3. Regulatory Compliance:
   - Risk: Changes in data privacy regulations or additional compliance requirements may increase costs.
   - Mitigation: We have budgeted for legal consultation and included compliance considerations in our development process. The contingency fund can cover minor additional costs.

4. Project Timeline Extensions:
   - Risk: Delays could increase labor costs.
   - Mitigation: Our project management approach includes buffer time in critical path activities. We will closely monitor progress and communicate any potential delays early to minimize impact.

5. Integration Challenges:
   - Risk: Unforeseen difficulties in integrating with Dollar Funding's existing systems could require additional development time.
   - Mitigation: We have allocated time for integration testing and included a DevOps engineer in the team. If major issues arise, we may need to reassess the project scope or timeline.

6. Scalability Requirements:
   - Risk: If the system needs to scale beyond the initial 200% increase in volume, additional infrastructure costs may be incurred.
   - Mitigation: Our architecture is designed for scalability. We will monitor system performance and work with Dollar Funding to adjust the budget if significant scaling is required beyond the initial scope.
