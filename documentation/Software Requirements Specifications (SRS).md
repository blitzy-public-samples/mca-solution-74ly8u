This flowchart represents the main processes of the MCA application processing system:

1. Email Reception: The system receives emails at submissions@dollarfunding.com.

2. Email Processing: The system extracts metadata and attachments from the email.

3. Document Classification: Attachments are classified as ISO applications, bank statements, or voided checks.

4. OCR Processing: ISO applications undergo OCR to extract text information.

5. Data Extraction: The system extracts merchant details, funding details, and owner information from the OCR results.

6. Data Storage: Extracted data is stored in the database, while documents are stored in secure cloud storage.

7. Validation: The system checks for the presence of critical information (e.g., SSN, Federal Tax ID).

8. Status Update: The application status is updated based on the validation results.

9. Webhook Notification: The system sends notifications about the application status via webhooks.

10. Client Action: If review is required, the client is notified.

11. API and UI Updates: The processed information is made available through the API and reflected in the UI dashboard.

This flowchart provides a visual representation of the system's core functionality, from email reception to final processing and notification. The backend processes are implemented in Python, while the UI dashboard is developed using React and Tailwind CSS, maintaining consistency with the technology choices made earlier in the document.

## DATA REQUIREMENTS

### DATA MODELS

The MCA application processing system will use the following data models:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    Application ||--o{ Document : contains
    Application ||--o{ Merchant : has
    Application ||--o{ Owner : has
    Application ||--o{ FundingDetails : has

   - Data retention: Documents will be stored for the same duration as the application data (7 years minimum).
   - Redundancy: Multi-regional storage will be used to ensure high availability and durability.
   - Backup: Versioning will be enabled on Cloud Storage buckets to allow for easy recovery of overwritten or deleted objects.
   - Recovery: A separate backup bucket will be maintained with daily synchronization of all documents.

3. Scalability:
   - Cloud SQL: Vertical scaling (increasing machine type) and read replicas will be used to handle increased database load.
   - Cloud Storage: Designed for exabyte scale, no additional configuration needed for scalability.

4. Data Archiving:
   - After 2 years, application data and documents will be moved to a separate long-term storage solution (Google Cloud Storage Archive class) for cost optimization while maintaining compliance with retention policies.

### DATA PROCESSING

The data processing flow in the MCA application processing system will follow these steps:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Email Received] -->|Extract| B[Classify Documents]
    B -->|ISO Application| C[OCR Processing]
    B -->|Bank Statements| D[Store in Cloud Storage]
    B -->|Voided Check| D
    C -->|Extract Data| E[Data Validation]
    E -->|Valid| F[Store in Cloud SQL]
    E -->|Invalid| G[Flag for Review]
    F --> H[Trigger Webhook]
    G --> H
    H --> I[Update UI]
```

1. Data Security:
   - Encryption at rest: All data stored in Cloud SQL and Cloud Storage will be encrypted using Google-managed encryption keys.
   - Encryption in transit: All data transfers will use TLS 1.2 or higher.
   - Access Control: 
     - Identity and Access Management (IAM) will be used to control access to Cloud SQL and Cloud Storage.
     - Application-level role-based access control will be implemented for UI and API access.
   - Data Masking: Sensitive information (e.g., SSN, Tax ID) will be masked in the UI and API responses unless explicitly requested by authorized users.
   - Audit Logging: All data access and modifications will be logged using Google Cloud Audit Logs.

2. Data Processing Steps:
   a. Email Processing:
      - Emails received at submissions@dollarfunding.com are processed by a Python backend service.
      - Email metadata is extracted and stored in Cloud SQL.
      - Attachments are temporarily stored in a secure Cloud Storage bucket.

   b. Document Classification:
      - A machine learning model classifies the PDF documents.
      - Classified documents are moved to appropriate Cloud Storage buckets based on their type.

   c. OCR and Data Extraction:
      - ISO applications undergo OCR processing using Google Cloud Vision API.
      - Extracted data is validated against predefined rules and data types.
      - Valid data is stored in Cloud SQL; invalid data is flagged for review.

   d. Data Access:
      - A Python backend provides a RESTful API for data access.
      - The API uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication and JWT for authorization.
      - Rate limiting is implemented to prevent abuse.

   e. User Interface:
      - A React-based UI with Tailwind CSS provides a dashboard for viewing and managing applications.
      - The UI communicates with the backend API using secure HTTPS connections.

   f. Webhook Notifications:
      - A Python service sends webhook notifications for application status updates.
      - Webhook URLs and secrets are stored securely in Cloud SQL.
      - Retry logic is implemented for failed webhook deliveries.

3. Data Integrity:
   - Database transactions are used to ensure data consistency.
   - Regular data integrity checks are performed to detect and correct any inconsistencies.
   - A separate data quality service continuously monitors and reports on data accuracy and completeness.

4. Data Transformation:
   - ETL processes are implemented using Google Cloud Dataflow for any required data transformations or aggregations.
   - These processes run on a scheduled basis to update reporting tables and analytics datasets.

By implementing these data requirements, the MCA application processing system will ensure secure, scalable, and efficient handling of application data throughout its lifecycle.
