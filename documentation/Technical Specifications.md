    Application ||--o{ Document : contains
    Application ||--o{ Merchant : has
    Application ||--o{ Owner : has
    Application ||--o{ FundingDetails : has
    Application ||--|| Status : has
    Document ||--|| DocumentType : has
    User ||--o{ Application : processes
    Webhook ||--o{ Application : notifies

    Application {
        uuid id PK
        uuid email_id FK
        timestamp received_at
        uuid status_id FK
        uuid processed_by FK
    }

    Document {
        uuid id PK
        uuid application_id FK
        uuid document_type_id FK
        string storage_url
        timestamp uploaded_at
    }

    Merchant {
        uuid id PK
        uuid application_id FK
        string legal_name
        string dba_name
        string federal_tax_id
        string address
        string industry
        decimal annual_revenue
    }

    Owner {
        uuid id PK
        uuid application_id FK
        string name
        string ssn
        string address
        date date_of_birth
        decimal ownership_percentage
    }

    FundingDetails {
        uuid id PK
        uuid application_id FK
        decimal amount_requested
        string use_of_funds
    }

    Status {
        uuid id PK
        string name
    }

    DocumentType {
        uuid id PK
        string name
    }

    User {
        uuid id PK
        string username
        string email
        string hashed_password
        uuid role_id FK
    }

    Webhook {
        uuid id PK
        string url
        string secret_key

1. User Authentication:
   - Implement OAuth 2.0 with OpenID Connect using Google Cloud Identity Platform
   - Support multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all user accounts
   - Enforce strong password policies (minimum length, complexity, expiration)

2. API Authentication:
   - Use API keys for external system integrations
   - Implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless authentication

3. Service-to-Service Authentication:
   - Utilize Google Cloud Service Accounts for internal service communication

### Authorization

1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
   - Implement fine-grained RBAC using Google Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM)
   - Define the following roles:
     - Administrator
     - Manager
     - Processor
     - Auditor
     - API Client

2. Access Control Matrix:

| Role         | View Applications | Edit Applications | Manage Users | Access API | View Reports |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------|------------|--------------|
| Administrator| ✓                 | ✓                 | ✓            | ✓          | ✓            |
| Manager      | ✓                 | ✓                 |              | ✓          | ✓            |
| Processor    | ✓                 | ✓                 |              |            |              |
| Auditor      | ✓                 |                   |              |            | ✓            |
| API Client   |                   |                   |              | ✓          |              |
