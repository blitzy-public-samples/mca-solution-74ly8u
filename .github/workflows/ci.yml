# HUMAN ASSISTANCE NEEDED
# Please review the following:
# 1. Ensure that the Python and Node.js versions are correct for your project.
# 2. Verify that the paths to requirements.txt and frontend directory are correct.
# 3. Confirm that the test commands (pytest for backend, npm run test for frontend) are appropriate for your project setup.
# 4. Check if additional environment variables or secrets are needed for the CI process.
